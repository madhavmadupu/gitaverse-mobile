# Gitaverse Mobile App - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Route Configuration Warnings

**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate route definitions in `app/_layout.tsx`
- Fixed route guard logic to properly handle onboarding route
- Routes are now properly nested and accessible

### 2. ✅ Onboarding Data Saving Error
**Problem**: "Error saving onboarding data" when completing onboarding
**Solution**:
- Added user record creation in `utils/api.ts` to ensure user exists in `users` table
- Updated `updateUserSettings` method to create user record if it doesn't exist
- Added user record creation in signup process
- Improved error handling in onboarding flow

### 3. ✅ Notifications ProjectId Error
**Problem**: "No projectId found" error in notifications
**Solution**:
- Added `projectId` field to `app.json`
- Updated notifications service to handle projectId errors gracefully

- Improved share text formatting

### 6. ✅ Speech Reader Implementation
**Problem**: Need text-to-speech with controls
**Solution**:
- Created `utils/speech.ts` service with play/pause/stop functionality
- Created `components/SpeechPlayer.tsx` component
- Integrated speech player above bottom tab bar
- Added Hindi language support for Sanskrit text

## Database Schema Recommendations

### Current Schema Issues
The current schema has some inconsistencies that should be addressed:

1. **Data Type Inconsistencies**:
   - Some tables use `text` for IDs while others use `uuid`
   - Foreign key relationships need to be consistent

2. **Missing Indexes**:
   - Add indexes for better query performance
   - Index on frequently queried columns

3. **Row Level Security (RLS)**:
   - Enable RLS on all tables
   - Add proper policies for data access

### Recommended Schema Changes

```sql
-- Key changes needed:

1. Ensure all ID columns are UUID type
2. Add proper indexes:
   CREATE INDEX idx_verses_chapter_id ON public.verses(chapter_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_user_progress_user_id ON public.user_progress(user_id);
   CREATE INDEX idx_daily_streaks_user_id ON public.daily_streaks(user_id);

3. Enable RLS on all tables:
   ALTER TABLE public.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE public.verses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   -- ... (for all tables)

4. Add RLS policies:
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON public.users FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
   CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view verses" ON public.verses FOR SELECT USING (true);
   -- ... (appropriate policies for each table)
```
